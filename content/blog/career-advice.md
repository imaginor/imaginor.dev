In 5+ years since my final project at General Assembly, I've been incredibly fortunate to have two amazing software engineering positions.  I've also never forgotten the half a year I spent following graduation, grappling with the reality of a harsh and competitive job landscape where I failed to get interviews at all.  I have often been asked how I landed a full-time role at ${companyName}?  How can a recent bootcamp graduate set themselves up to do the same?  These are some soft tips from my own experience: struggling to get an interview, to landing my first role, mentoring other graduates, and interviewing junior developers.<br /><br />

## Persistence

The job search can be frustrating and difficult.  Juggling applications, cover letters, sharpening skills, and building out a portfolio all feels like a job itself.  It can never be said enough:  <b>don't give up</b>!  Interviewing is a specific skill set that requires practice to develop.  Upon entering bootcamp I was so excited to begin my career, assuming I'd be completely prepared to land the job of my dreams as soon as I graduated.  Fast forward two months after turning in my final project, and I was so anxious from all the rejections that I stopped applying altogether and wondered if I'd made a huge mistake.  <b>Take it easy on yourself</b>.  Every phone screen, practice algorithm, and lunch hour spent studying is a learning opportunity that will eventually lead you to your first role.

## Solidify your Foundations



## Articulate your Technical Knowledge

In an interview setting you'll likely do a deep dive into technology you've leveraged in a project or learned in bootcamp.  I will long remember describing <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record</a> (an ORM for Ruby On Rails) as "uhh, a thing that connects with the database" in an interview :facepalmemoji.  I knew how to <i>use</i> the technology, but didn't know how to articulate that knowledge.  Have a classmate, friend, or loved one ask mock interview questions describing a technology.  No one around?  Describe to the mirror why Node was a good backend for your project, or talk to the cat about React lifecycle methods.  You (or your cat) might think you sound crazy - but the more you hear yourself articulating your knowledge, the better you'll feel in an interview.
## Use networking to your advantage

Just applied to a junior developer position that you feel is a great fit?  Use LinkedIn to search for engineers at that company in a similar position.  Send an introductory message and ask for a few minutes of their time to discuss the position and company culture.  Though many messages go unnoticed, plenty of engineers will deeply understand the struggle of job searchers face.  To this day I keep up with a few bootcampers who messaged me on LinkedIn, one of whom is now a colleague.  At the very least you'll create a lasting connection - and in some cases you may even end up with a referral.

## Practice makes great
