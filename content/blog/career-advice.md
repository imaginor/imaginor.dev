In the five years since my last day at General Assembly, I've been incredibly fortunate to work for two amazing companies as a software developer.  I've also never forgotten the half a year following graduation when I struggled to land interviews and grappled with the reality of a harsh, competitive job landscape.  Often times I have been asked how I landed a full-time role at ${companyName}?  How can a recent bootcamp graduate set themselves up to do the same?  These are a few soft tips based on my own personal experiences after bootcamp - from struggling to get an interview, to landing my first role, mentoring other graduates, and interviewing junior developers.<br /><br />

## Persistence

The job search can be frustrating and difficult.  Half of your applications seem to fall into a massive black hole of resumes, piling up on a server in another galaxy.  Juggling applications, cover letters, sharpening your skills, and building out your portfolio all feels like a job itself.  It can never be said enough:  <b>don't give up</b>!  Interviewing is a specific skill set that requires practice to develop.  Upon entering bootcamp I remember how excited I was to begin my career, assuming I'd be completely prepared to land the job of my dreams as soon as I graduated.  Fast forward two months after turning in my final project, and I was so anxious from all the rejections that I stopped applying altogether and wondered if I'd made a huge mistake.  <b>Take it easy on yourself</b>.  Every phone screen, practice algorithm, and hour of studying is another learning opportunity that will eventually lead you to your first role.

## Solidify your Foundations



## Articulate your Technical Knowledge

In an interview setting you'll almost certainly be taking a deep dive into technology you've leveraged in a project or learned about in school.  I will always remember my first interview being asked to describe <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record</a>, an ORM for Ruby On Rails.  I could only stammer that Active Record was "uhh, a thing that connects with the database".  :facepalmemoji.  I <i>knew</i> how to use the technology, but struggled to <i>articulate</i> that knowledge.  Becoming comfortable in this skill can take time.  Connecting regularly with classmates, or even answering mock interview questions in the mirror will go a long way.  Carve out a small amount of time each day to practice this and you'll feel much better in your next interview.

## Use networking to your advantage

Networking is extremely useful when used to your advantage.  Just applied to a junior developer position that you feel is a great fit?  Use LinkedIn to search for engineers at that company in a similar position.  Send an introductory message and ask for a few minutes of their time to discuss the position and company.  Though many messages will go unnoticed, there are plenty of engineers who understand the struggle of looking for their first job.  At the very least, you'll make a connection that might just come in handy down the road.  

## Practice makes great
